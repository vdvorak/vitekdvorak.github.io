My last task at [Navigo3](https://navigo3.com/) was to find the way, how to integrate BIM into our software.  
I worked with BIM-based software from [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) - [BIM 360](https://www.autodesk.com/bim-360/).

## Basic structure

Our user is for example architect and he works on project A for his Customer1 and project B for Customer2 and he wants to see his issues in Navigo.

## What is...

**Admin account** - Autodesk account with assigned an instance of BIM 360 ([Sign in](https://admin.b360.autodesk.com))  
**Employee account** - basic Autodesk account ([Sign in](<(https://www.autodesk.com/)>))  
**Client app** - representation of the client's software ([Sign in](https://forge.autodesk.com/))  
**Callback URL** - after the first authentification, the client will be redirected to this URL with an authentication code  
**Access token** - allows you to retrieve data from BIM 360
**Refresh token** - allows you to get a new Access token without contacting the user

## Building a testing environment

1. **Creating an [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) accounts**

   - Company account (**OurCompany**)
   - Employee account (**OurEmployee**)
   - Company's client account (**OtherCompany**)
   - Application account (**application**)

2. **Creating a client app**

   - Sign in at [Autodesk forge](https://forge.autodesk.com/) with an App account
   - Go to my apps
   - Create a new app
   - Set app name and callback URL
     <br />

3. **Request a [BIM 360 demo](https://www.autodesk.com/bim-360/start-for-free/) for OurCompany and OtherCompany**

4. **Prepare a project for the OurCompany and OtherCompany**

   - Sign in at [BIM 360 admin](https://admin.b360.autodesk.com)
   - Create a testing project
   - Click on the project in the project list
   - On the page, you have been redirected to click to "Add member" and fill an email with the email of OurEmployee

5. **Connect your client app to the OurCompany and OtherCompany**
   - Sign in at [BIM 360 admin](https://admin.b360.autodesk.com)
   - Go to settings
   - Open "Custom integrations"
   - Create new custom integration
     - Select only "Document Management"
     - Select "I am a developer"
     - Go to the app you have created in step 2 and copy the client id to fill the dialog window
     - Type some name of integration and click save

## BIM 360 Authentication

To read any data of project you have to go through "Three-legged authentication"

### Step by step

1. **Getting access token with users attention** (First authentication or missing refresh token)
   <br />
   <br />
   - **Getting authentication code**
     - **Usage:** Thanks to the refresh token this step is required only once at the beginning, placed for example on some button
     - **URL:** [https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v1/authorize](https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v1/authorize)
     - **Parameters:**
       - Client id (at your [Forge App](https://forge.autodesk.com/))
       - Client secret
       - Client callback URL (redirect_uri)
       - Type of response (**response_type**=code)
       - Access privileges you want to get from the user (**scope**=data:read)
     - **What will happen:**
       - User will be redirected to the Autodesk authentication page
       - After the user signs in he will be asked to grant privileges to your app
       - When the user allows app access he will be redirected to your callback URL with authentication code in the URL parameter
         <br />
         <br />
   - **Getting access token**
     - **Usage:** This token is used to authenticate your app when you requesting data
     - **URL:** "[https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v1/gettoken](https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v1/gettoken)"
     - **Headers:** "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-URLencoded"
     - **Method:** "POST"
     - **Parameters:**
       - client_id (in your [Forge App](https://forge.autodesk.com/))
       - client_secret
       - Client callback URL (redirect_uri)
       - Type of the authorization(**grant_type**=code)
       - Authentication code retrieved from the previous request
     - **What will hapen:** After submitting the request server sends a response including "Access token" and "Refresh token"
       <br />
       <br />
2. **Getting access token with the refresh token**
   - **Usage:** This token is used to authenticate your app when you requesting data
   - **URL:** "[https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v1/refreshtoken](https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v1/refreshtoken)"
   - **Headers:** "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-URLencoded"
   - **Method:** "POST"
   - **Parameters:**
     - client_id (in your [Forge App](https://forge.autodesk.com/))
     - client_secret
     - Type of authorzation (**grant_type**=refresh_token)
     - Refresh token you have stored
   - **What will hapen:** After submitting the request server sends a response including "Access token" and "Refresh token"
