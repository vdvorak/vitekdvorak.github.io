My last task in [Navigo3](https://navigo3.com/) was to find the way, how to integrate BIM to display users issues.
We decided to work with BIM based software from [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) [BIM 360](https://www.autodesk.com/bim-360/).

## Useful info
 - Employees accounts are not not directly connected to specific company
 - To retrieve any project data project owner have to connect your client app


## Building testing enviroment

  1. **Create accounts at [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/)**
      - representing your client (OurCompany)
      - representing client of your client (OtherCompany)
      - representing employee of your company (OurEmployee)
      - representing your application (App)
   
  2. **Create client app**
      1. Sign in at [Autodesk forge](https://forge.autodesk.com/)  with App account
      2. Go to my apps
      3. Create new app
      4. Set app name and callback url
   
  3. **Request BIM 360 demo at (https://www.autodesk.com/bim-360/start-for-free/) for (OurCompany, OtherCompany)** - It takes some time to establish demo
  
   <div style="color:red; font-weight:600">Following steps will be available only when your demo has benn already deployed!</div>
  
  4. **Prepare projec for (OurCompany, OtherCompany)**
      1. Sign in at [BIM 360 admin](https://admin.b360.autodesk.com)  
      2. Create your testing project
      3. Click on project in projects list
      4. On the page you have been redirected to click to "Add member" and fill email with email of OurEmployee
 
  5. **Connect your client app with OurCompany and OtherCompany**
       1. Sign in at [BIM 360 admin](https://admin.b360.autodesk.com)  
       2. Go to settings
       3. Custom integrations
       4. Create new custom integration
           1. Select only "Document Management"
           2. Select "I am developer"
           3. Go to app you have created in step 2 and copy client id to fill dialog window
           4. Type some name of integration and click save
