My last task in [Navigo3](https://navigo3.com/) was to find the way, how to integrate BIM.
We decided to work with BIM based software from [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) [BIM 360](https://www.autodesk.com/bim-360/).

## Basic implementation structure

## What is ?
 - Admin account - Account with demo of BIM 360 mostly owned by company ([Sign in](https://admin.b360.autodesk.com))
 - Account of employee - Basic autodesk account assigned to some project ([Sign in]((https://www.autodesk.com/)))
 - Client app - Basic representation of identity of your app ([Sign in](https://forge.autodesk.com/))
 - Callback url - When is user authenticated for the first time after allowing he will be redirected to this url with authentication code
 - refresh token - Allows you to get new **Access token** without bothering the user

## Building testing enviroment
  <br />
  1. **Create accounts at [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) for**
      - Your client (**OurCompany**)
      - Client of your client (**OtherCompany**)

      - Your application (**App**)

      2. Go to my apps
      3. Create new app

   <br />
  3. **Request BIM 360 demo at (https://www.autodesk.com/bim-360/start-for-free/) for (OurCompany, OtherCompany)** - It takes some time to establish demo
  <br />
  <div style="color:red; font-weight:600">Following steps will be available only when your demo has been already deployed!</div>
  <br />
  4. **Prepare projec for OurCompany and OtherCompany**

      4. On the page you have been redirected to click to "Add member" and fill email with email of OurEmployee
  <br />
