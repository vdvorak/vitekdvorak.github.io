## Learning
  ⚠️ **LEARN ON YOUR SELF**
  
  It's about five years ago I have learned to program and I'm still learning, I think a good programmer should never stop. The most important thing when you are learning programming basics is to fully understand the programming logic and principles it doesn't matter which langue you work with if you understand the principles you know what to use when you have a list of items and need to work with each of them. You only have to find out the syntax.

### Languages to start with
  1. Java/C# - on the first place because beginner should start with static data typing to understand them, brackets, basic syntax
  2. Python - basic syntax, not statically typed, indention instead of brackets (IDE can handle)



## Teaching

### Important rules
  - **Let student think** about what he is doing and has to do!

  - Hint for the student **mustn't be specifically said** - for example, he needs to save value to a variable, tell him "You have to assign a memory for this"

  - If a student doesn't know what is wrong or what to do, **don't tell him**, let him read out loud the code, and **listen** what he thinks how each line works!

  - **Don't share your code** with students when solving the specific problem!

  - Require student's **work submission**!

  - Work on a **bigger projects** - don't create a new project for each lesson

### Teaching basics
  1. Give him knowledge about programming basics - data types, variables, conditions, cycles, functions, strings
  2. Give him some assignments to test if he understands - if not go through
  3. The most important thing you have to teach is problem decomposition the student must be able to decompose the problem to basic programming techniques for this can help to find some problem from the student's environment, is he a player shooting game? OK let him decompose how reloading is working, this helps him to think about the problem and will be more interested in it.
  3. OOP
