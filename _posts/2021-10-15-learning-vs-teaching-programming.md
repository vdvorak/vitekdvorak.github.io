# Learning VS teaching programming

## Learning
  ⚠️ **LEARN ON YOUR SELF**
  
  It's about five years I have learned to program and I'm still learning, I thing good programmer should never stop. The most important thing when you are learning
  programming basics is to fully understand the programming logic and principes it doesn't metter which langue you work with if you understand the principes you know
  what to use when you have list of items and need to iterate them. You only have to find out the syntax.

### Languages to start with
  1. Java/C# - on the first place because beginner should start with static data typing to understant them, brackets, basic syntax
  2. Python - basic syntax, not staticly typed, indention insted of brackets (IDE can handle)



## Teaching

### Important rules
  - **Let student think** about what he is doing and has to do!

  - Hint for the student **mustn't be specificly sayed** - for example he needs to save value to a variable, tell him "You have to assign a memory for this"

  - If student dont know what is wrong or what to do, **don't tell him**, let him read out loud the code and **listen** what he thinks how each line works!

  - **Don't share your code** with students when solving specific problem!

  - Require student's **work submition**!

  - Work on a **bigger projects** - don't create new project each lesson

## Teaching basics
  1. Give him a knowlage about programming basics - data types, variables, conditions, cycles, functions, strings
  2. Give him some assignments to test if he realy understands - if not go through
  3. The most important thing you have to teach is problem decomposition the student must be able to decompose the problem to basic programming techniques for this can help
  finding some problem from student's enviroment, is he a player shooting games ? OK let him decompose how reloading is working, this helps him to think problem and will be more interested in.
  3. OOP
